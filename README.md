# User Manual

**Running in the same machine or same LAN**

* Clone the repository in your local machine.
* Run `MainClass.main()` first. The server is on now, waiting for clients to be connected.
* If you want to browse your local machine from your local machine:
  * Open a browser.
  * Go to `http://localhost:6969/C:/` to browse your C drive or put any drive location to browse it.
  * Click on any file to download it.
  * Run `Client.main()` and it will wait for a file name input. Type the file name or give path to the file 
    to upload it to the root directory.
  * **Notice:** If you type only filename to upload it, it must be in the root directory.

**Running Over the Net** 

You will need a Public Ip address for this.
* Run `MainClass.main()` in the machine having a Public IP
* Open a browser in any other machine. 
* Go to `http://yourIpAddress:6969/C:/` to browse your C drive or put any drive location to browse it. 
  Here you need to put the machine's IP in which `MainClass.main()` is running.
* Click on any file to download it. 
* For file uploading, You need to change `Client.java`.

```javascript
  Socket connection = new Socket("localhost", 6969);
```
* Here replace `localhost` with your server machine's IP. For example, 
```javascript
  Socket connection = new Socket("103.84.253.245", 6969);
```  
* Now run `Client.main()` and it will wait for a file name input. Type the file name or give path to the file 
  to upload it.
* Uploaded file from client's machine will be stored in the root directory of server.
